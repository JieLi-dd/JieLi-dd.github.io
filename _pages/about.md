👋 Hi! I am 🙋‍♂️ Jie Li（李杰）, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and Technology at the School of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Mining and Technology ([CUMT](https://www.cumt.edu.cn/)). I am a member of the Joint Lab of Intelligent Information Processing ([JLIIP](http://www.jliip.org/)), CUMT-CAS, under the supervision of Prof. 👴 [Shifei Ding](https://cs.cumt.edu.cn/info/1096/4454.htm) and co-advisor Associate Prof. 👩‍🏫 [Lili Guo](https://cs.cumt.edu.cn/info/1097/6311.htm).

I received my Bachelor's degree in Engineering from the School of Resources and Geosciences, CUMT, majoring in Resource Exploration Engineering with a focus on Geoscience and Information Technology.

My current research focuses on multimodal emotion recognition. If you are interested in this research direction, please feel free to contact me. I am also applying for Ph.D. programs for Fall 2026 and welcome any potential opportunities from faculty with available positions.
